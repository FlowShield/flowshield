CloudSlit aims to build a global web3 decentralized zero trust security network system to help users regain the private security information eroded by giants under web2, so that the current global hot zero trust security network technology can better help users master their own security privacy data in combination with web3, and give users a good zero trust security network products and platform experience.

# Project Design
## [CloudSlit-Fullnode](https://github.com/CloudSlit/cloudslit/tree/main/fullnode)
Anyone can run a full node, which hosts the metadata of the decentralized network, and provides a metadata networking and transaction matching platform.

For all users and Dao's data, we use Filecoin's web3.storage decentralized storage of user data.

## [CloudSlit-Provider](https://github.com/CloudSlit/cloudslit/tree/main/provider)
Our nodes realize automatic networking through peer discovery and routing through libp2p kademlia DHT and IPFs networks, and realize data synchronization between multiple nodes through libp2p's PubSub function.

## [CloudSlit-Contract](https://github.com/CloudSlit/cloudslit/tree/main/contract)
We use nervos to deploy smart contracts.Provide a safe trading process and a safe trading environment.

## [CloudSlit-Client](https://github.com/CloudSlit/cloudslit/tree/main/client)
The client software user connects to the provider to establish a zero trust network security tunnel.
