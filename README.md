# Our mission

In the field of new generation network security communications, the FlowShield project is leading a revolution. With the rapid development of the digital age, we are facing more and more network security threats and privacy issues. Traditional secure communications solutions are no longer able to meet the growing demands, so we need an innovative approach to protect our communications and data.

FlowShield adopts a series of cutting-edge technologies, such as blockchain, encryption algorithms and secure network architecture, to provide a strong guarantee for the new generation of network secure communication. Through decentralized design, FlowShield breaks the traditional centralized model and makes communication more secure and reliable. Each participant can jointly build and maintain this network, contributing to the security of the entire ecosystem.

</p>

FlowShield not only focuses on data encryption and transmission security, but also on privacy protection. The project is committed to protecting the personal privacy of users and preventing their sensitive information from being misused or leaked. Through an anonymized and decentralized approach, FlowShield ensures that users’ identities and communication content are protected to the greatest extent possible, allowing them to have greater autonomy and control in the digital world.

# I. Dao Node

Fullnode is a node open to everyone to participate. It carries the metadata of the distributed network and provides a metadata network and transaction matching platform. Fullnode ensures the online status of providers by integrating the metadata of individual providers and maintaining a heartbeat connection with the provider using the libp2p-based pubsub protocol. Users can use Fullnode to find resources and nodes, build their own secure and anonymous network tunnels, and be rewarded by paying tokens to provider nodes. At the same time, Fullnode uses Filecoin's web3.storage technology to store user and Dao data in a distributed manner to ensure data security and reliability.

# II. Network Provider

Our nodes are automatically networked through kademlia DHT and IPFS networks of libp2p through peer discovery and routing, and data synchronization among multiple nodes is realized through PubSub function of libp2p.

For all users and Dao data, we use web3.storage of Filecoin to store user data in a decentralized way.

# III. Smart Contracts

We provide a complete smart contract for the decentralized trusted bandwidth market. Our smart contract is deployed on the EVM network, and we provide many methods in the smart contract to ensure a safe trading process and a safe trading environment.

# IV. Network Verifier

We provide the verifier component for the decentralized trusted bandwidth market. Anyone can run the network verifier, monitor the network quality of ongoing orders, and detect and punish illegal and bad network providers.

# V. DeCA 


Decentralize PKI CA center to provide communication authentication infrastructure for Dao point-to-point communication.

DeCA has advantages at every stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes the autonomous control of online identity possible, and provides a simple and more powerful SSL certificate. In use, it can help entities finally store encrypted data by degrading public key management to security decentralization.

# VI. Access Client

A client user connects to a provider to establish a network security tunnel for private data retrieval.
