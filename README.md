# Our Mission

In the realm of next-generation network security communications, the FlowShield project is spearheading a revolution. As the digital age advances rapidly, we face increasing network security threats and privacy issues. Traditional secure communications solutions can no longer meet the growing demands, necessitating an innovative approach to protect our communications and data.

FlowShield employs cutting-edge technologies, such as blockchain, advanced encryption algorithms, and secure network architecture, to provide robust guarantees for next-generation network secure communication. By adopting a decentralized design, FlowShield transcends the traditional centralized model, enhancing communication security and reliability. Each participant plays a role in building and maintaining this network, contributing to the security of the entire ecosystem.

</p>

FlowShield not only emphasizes data encryption and transmission security but also prioritizes privacy protection. The project is dedicated to safeguarding users' personal privacy, preventing misuse or leakage of sensitive information. Through anonymized and decentralized approaches, FlowShield ensures the utmost protection of users' identities and communication content, granting them greater autonomy and control in the digital world.

# Components

## I. DAO Node

Fullnode is accessible to everyone for participation. It carries the metadata of the distributed network and provides a metadata network and transaction matching platform. Fullnode ensures the online status of providers by integrating their metadata and maintaining a heartbeat connection using the libp2p-based pubsub protocol. Users can leverage Fullnode to find resources and nodes, build their secure and anonymous network tunnels, and receive rewards by paying tokens to provider nodes. Fullnode also uses Filecoin's web3.storage technology to store user and DAO data in a distributed manner, ensuring data security and reliability.

</p>

## II. Network Provider

Network provider nodes are automatically networked through the IPFS network of Kademlia DHT and libp2p, utilizing peer discovery and routing functions for fast communication and data synchronization. Using the PubSub function of libp2p, data can be efficiently published and subscribed to between multiple nodes.

</p>

## III. Smart Contracts

We provide comprehensive smart contracts for the decentralized trusted bandwidth market. Our smart contracts are deployed on the EVM network, offering numerous methods to ensure a secure trading process and environment.

</p>

## IV. Network Verifier

The validator component of our decentralized trusted bandwidth marketplace monitors network quality, detects and penalizes malicious network providers, and ensures the fairness, reliability, and security of transactions. Our commitment is to build a healthy and thriving market, allowing users to participate with confidence and enjoy high-quality bandwidth services.

</p>

## V. DeCA 

DeCA decentralizes the PKI infrastructure, providing point-to-point communication identity and authentication capabilities for each network node. It implements autonomous identity control and offers simple yet powerful PKI control capabilities. Through decentralized authentication and key management, DeCA ensures the confidentiality and integrity of communications. FlowShield network participants have autonomous control over their online identities, receiving enhanced authentication and encryption protection. Build a trusted point-to-point communication network through DeCA to improve data and communication security, and enhance the reliability and security of the FlowShield network.

## VI. Access Client

The client user establishes a connection with the provider through network access, creating a secure network tunnel for private data retrieval. Authentication and encryption technologies ensure the security and privacy of data transmission.

# Future Upgrades

### I. Decentralized Network Support

We plan to integrate support for decentralized network NATS, enabling robust and scalable real-time messaging.

### II. DPKI Infrastructure Upgrade

Enhancements to our Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) to provide even more secure and efficient key management.

### III. Integration with Decentralized Immutable Database

Nodes will incorporate decentralized immutable databases to ensure data integrity and tamper resistance.

### IV. WASM Compute Capabilities

DAO and miner nodes will be enhanced with WebAssembly (WASM) compute capabilities, facilitating more efficient and versatile computation.
